# Houdini Visualizations

I have received many questions around how I made the visualizations for my presentation "Place like I do! Example-based procedural placements in a dialogue system". Therefore, I decided to share my work files with everyone ðŸ˜€ 

I have not anticipated that anyone else will be looking into them except myself, so...  it's a bit messy (but I tried to clean up and group, so you dont feel completely lost!). Anyway, hope it can be educational regardless ðŸ˜‡

Example of visualizations from the presentation:
